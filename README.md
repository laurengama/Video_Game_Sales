# Video_Game_Sales

#### Description
Our data science group project depicts video game sales from the 1980s to 2016. Users can utilize a drop-down menu to view data by region and see how sales varied by genre, publisher, platform, ESRB Rating, critic scores, user scores, and year.

#### Motivation
For this project, we were prompted to create a business presentation. We were allowed to use any data and pick any industry, so we chose something that made us all excited and a bit nostalgic: video games. Once we found our [dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings), we wanted to be able to answer questions about which types of games had the highest sales.
