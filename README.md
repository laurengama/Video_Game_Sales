# Video_Game_Sales

#### Description
Our data science group project depicts video game sales from the 1980s to 2016. Users can utilize a drop-down menu to view data by region and see how sales varied by genre, publisher, platform, ESRB Rating, critic scores, user scores, and year.

#### Motivation
For this project, we were prompted to create a business presentation. We were allowed to use any data and pick any industry, so we chose something that made us all excited and a bit nostalgic: video games. Once we found our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings), we wanted to be able to answer questions about which types of games had the highest sales.

#### Result
Using a flask app and D3.js we were able to pull data from the csv file and create various sales charts. A drop-down menu on the page allows the user to toggle between the following regions: Global, North American, European, Japanese, and Other. Making a selection then reveals graphs depicting sales against a number of variables. Users can then gain an understanding of which types of video games fare best in different regions of the world.

#### Team Efforts
Kevin was responsible for creating the flask app and adding CSS styling to our page. Myke was responsible for pulling findings from the data to report in our business presentation. I was responsible for creating the D3 charts and organizing them in the HTML.
